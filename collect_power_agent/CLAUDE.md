# Coding Rules for this Project

## RULE: Check for SKILL.md in the same subdirectory before working on any file

Before reading, writing, or editing any file under a subdirectory, check whether a
`SKILL.md` file exists in that same directory. If it does, read it first — it contains
subdirectory-specific conventions, patterns, and constraints that take precedence over
general project rules.

```
# Example: editing functions-crm/handlers/contacts.py
# → check for functions-crm/handlers/SKILL.md
# → check for functions-crm/SKILL.md
# → then apply general CLAUDE.md rules
```

Walk up one level too: if no `SKILL.md` in the immediate directory, check the parent
subdirectory (but not the project root — that is this file).


## THE OVERARCHING RULE: parallel work → isolated classes

Whenever you create parallel processes — whether with `asyncio` (gather, queues,
producer/consumer) or with multiple threads (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, `threading.Thread`)
— ALWAYS wrap each unit of work in its own isolated class.

Each such class must:

- own all of its mutable state (no shared globals/dicts/sets/counters across units),
- never raise out of its public entry point (catch-all → return a result object),
- never run past a hard timeout (`asyncio.wait_for` for coroutines; bounded waits for
  threads),
- route every I/O / body read through a single shared, capped, never-raising helper
  class (e.g. `BoundedFetcher`).

The goal: one unit failing, hanging, or timing out can NEVER stall, crash, or corrupt
any sibling. The reference implementation lives in `app/functions/async_worker.py`
(`BoundedFetcher`, `Worker`/`WorkerResult`) with `site_agent.py`
(`SiteWorker`, `SitemapReader`) as the worked example. Every rule below is a concrete
consequence of this one.

## Async / asyncio

### RULE: Every `run_in_executor` call for I/O MUST have an `asyncio.wait_for` timeout

When wrapping a synchronous blocking call (Firestore, database, HTTP, file I/O) in
`loop.run_in_executor`, the underlying thread cannot be cancelled. If the I/O hangs
indefinitely, the awaiting coroutine is stuck — and if that coroutine is a consumer in a
producer/consumer pipeline, it will never process its shutdown sentinel, causing the
entire `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to hang forever.

**Always write:**
```python
await asyncio.wait_for(
    loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: blocking_call(...)),
    timeout=12.0,   # or another appropriate value
)
```

**Never write:**
```python
await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: blocking_call(...))   # NO TIMEOUT — can hang forever
```

This bug was discovered in `site_agent.py`: `upsert_site_excluded` (Firestore write) had no
timeout. On a slow connection the consumer hung, sentinels were never processed, and
`asyncio.gather(*consumer_tasks)` never returned.

---

### RULE: Executor calls for external searches also need a timeout

Wrap `run_in_executor` calls to external APIs (e.g. Bing search) in `asyncio.wait_for` too:

```python
urls = await asyncio.wait_for(
    loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: bing_search(query, n)),
    timeout=45.0,
)
```

The thread will keep running after the timeout (threads can't be cancelled), but the
coroutine moves on and the program doesn't hang.

---

### RULE: Async coroutines that call multiple awaits MUST have a top-level timeout

A coroutine that chains several `await` calls (e.g. fetch robots.txt → fetch N sitemaps →
fetch homepage → fetch contact pages) can take far longer than any single call's timeout.
Even though each inner `_async_get` has its own `timeout=N`, the **total** is unbounded.
If that coroutine runs inside a consumer, it can block the consumer indefinitely.

**Always wrap high-level async worker functions in `asyncio.wait_for`:**
```python
lead, excl_reason = await asyncio.wait_for(
    process_site_async(session, url, ...),
    timeout=120.0,   # hard ceiling for the entire site-processing chain
)
```

This bug caused the final `asyncio.gather(*consumer_tasks)` to hang after the last
printed item: one consumer was stuck inside `process_site_async` with no escape.
The per-call aiohttp timeouts protect individual requests, not the whole chain.

---

### RULE: Producer/consumer pipelines — sentinel guarantee

In any `queue.get()` consumer loop, `queue.task_done()` must be called unconditionally.
Use `try/finally`:

```python
while True:
    item = await queue.get()
    try:
        if item is SENTINEL:
            break
        # ... process item ...
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"error: {exc}")
    finally:
        queue.task_done()   # ALWAYS called, even on exception or break
```

Never put `queue.task_done()` inside the `try` body where an exception or a nested
`await` could prevent it from running.

---

## File Editing

## Command Line Arguments

### RULE: List filters use space-separated args plus common item delimiters

For command-line list filters, prefer `nargs="+"` so repeated items can be passed as
normal space-separated arguments. Also split each argument token on comma, semicolon,
pipe, and newline so pasted lists work consistently.

Example:
```bash
python app/outreach_send_run.py --campaigns NO_jun SE_jun
python app/outreach_send_run.py --campaigns NO_jun,SE_jun
python app/outreach_send_run.py --campaigns NO_jun;SE_jun
python app/outreach_send_run.py --campaigns NO_jun|SE_jun
```

Use this same strategy for campaign lists and any other CLI parameter that represents
a list of IDs. Omitting the list parameter must mean "all", not "none".

### RULE: Never use Edit/Write tools on large Python files directly

The Edit and Write tools truncate `site_agent.py` and similar large files at a fixed byte
boundary (~line 754 / ~34 KB). Always use Python scripts via bash for structural changes:

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
src = open(path).read()
src = src.replace(old, new, 1)
open(path, 'w').write(src)
PYEOF
```

After any edit to a large file, always verify:
```bash
python3 -m py_compile app/site_agent.py && echo OK
tail -5 app/site_agent.py   # confirm file is not truncated
```

If truncated, repair with:
```python
data = open(path, 'rb').read()
idx  = data.rfind(b'<last known good line>')
open(path, 'wb').write(data[:idx] + tail)
```

---

## Firebase / Firestore

- All Firestore writes in async consumers → `run_in_executor` + `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=12)`
- All Firestore reads at startup (preload) are sync and called before `asyncio.run()` — acceptable
- `firebase_admin` is sync-only; never call it directly in a coroutine without `run_in_executor`

---

## ElementTree

### RULE: Never use `or` to chain `Element.find()` calls

`xml.etree.ElementTree.Element` evaluates as **falsy** when it has no child elements,
even if it exists and has text content. A `<loc>` or `<lastmod>` node has text but no
children, so `bool(element)` is `False`.

**Never write:**
```python
loc = sm.find(f"{{{ns}}}loc") or sm.find("loc")   # WRONG — drops valid results
```

**Always write:**
```python
loc = sm.find(f"{{{ns}}}loc")
if loc is None:
    loc = sm.find("loc")
```

This bug caused `_index_entries` to return empty `children` lists for all sitemapindex
nodes, making every site report `pages=0 (index)`.

---

## Verification

### RULE: `py_compile` is NOT enough — always run `pyflakes` for undefined names

`python -m py_compile` only catches **syntax** errors. It passes on undefined-name bugs
that crash at runtime — these keep recurring in this project:

- `cfg.OPENAI_MODEL` used at module scope while `cfg` was only imported locally inside a
  function (`site_enrich_agent.py`)
- `_local_fb_lock` referenced but never defined (20 files at once)
- `cred` used in `initialize_app(cred)` while the cert was assigned to `c`
- `normalize_url(...)` used but never imported from `functions.utils` (`lead_agent.py`)

**After ANY edit, run both:**
```bash
python3 -m py_compile app/*.py
python3 -m pyflakes app/*.py | grep -i "undefined name"   # must print nothing
```
If `pyflakes` reports an undefined name, fix it before considering the task done.

### RULE: Never edit large files with the Edit/Write tools — they truncate

The Edit/Write tools silently truncate large files (`site_agent.py`, `lead_agent.py`,
`site_email_check.py`) mid-file, producing `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal` /
`'(' was never closed` at the tail. Always edit via a Python script in bash:
```bash
python3 - << 'PY'
p = "app/lead_agent.py"; s = open(p, encoding="utf-8").read()
s = s.replace(OLD, NEW, 1)
open(p, "w", encoding="utf-8").write(s)
PY
python3 -m py_compile app/lead_agent.py && tail -3 app/lead_agent.py   # confirm not truncated
```

---

## Thread Safety

These scripts run blocking Firestore/Firebase calls inside `ThreadPoolExecutor`
threads. Every variable touched by more than one thread MUST be protected by a
`threading.Lock`. (asyncio counters like `counters["done"] += 1` inside a coroutine
are safe without locks — asyncio is single-threaded; only `ThreadPoolExecutor` code
needs locks.)

### RULE: singletons use double-checked locking

`app/firestore_client.py` has a global `_db` singleton. Concurrent `_write_exec`
threads calling `get_firestore()` can double-init and corrupt the connection pool →
hangs. Never remove or bypass the lock.

```python
_singleton = None
_lock = threading.Lock()

def get_singleton():
    if _singleton is not None:        # fast path, no lock
        return _singleton
    with _lock:
        if _singleton is not None:    # re-check inside lock
            return _singleton
        _singleton = create_it()
    return _singleton
```

`initialize_app` in every `app/*.py` must be wrapped with `_local_fb_lock`
(`_threading.Lock()` defined at module top). Audit after adding any file:

```bash
python3 -c "
import os, re
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('app'):
    dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d != '__pycache__']
    for f in files:
        if not f.endswith('.py'): continue
        src = open(os.path.join(root,f), errors='replace').read()
        lines = src.splitlines()
        for i, l in enumerate(lines):
            if ('initialize_app' in l or 'firestore.client()' in l) and not l.strip().startswith('#'):
                ctx = chr(10).join(lines[max(0,i-30):i])
                if not re.search(r'with\s+_\w*lock\w*\s*:', ctx):
                    print(f'UNPROTECTED {root}/{f}:{i+1}  {l.strip()[:70]}')
"
```

### RULE: `_write_exec` writes are awaited with a timeout — never fire-and-forget

```python
# WRONG — no backpressure, floods the pool when Firestore is slow
_write_exec.submit(lambda: upsert_site_lead(lead, col))

# CORRECT — bounded consumer
await asyncio.wait_for(
    loop.run_in_executor(_write_exec, lambda _l=lead: upsert_site_lead(_l, col)),
    timeout=20.0,
)
```

Set the pool size to the number of consumer workers so every consumer can submit
at once: `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max(workers, 8))`.

### RULE: never `shutdown(wait=True)` inside an `async def`

```python
_write_exec.shutdown(wait=True)    # WRONG — freezes the event loop
_write_exec.shutdown(wait=False)   # CORRECT — threads drain in background
```

### RULE: `gather(*tasks)` fan-out helpers need a per-worker `wait_for`

Helpers that build `tasks = [...]` then `await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
(`fix_rescrape_contacts.py` `_recrawl_one`, `lead_enrich_contacts.py` `_enrich_one`)
will hang forever if one worker's chained awaits never return — `return_exceptions=True`
only catches *raised* exceptions, not a coroutine that never returns. Wrap each worker
in `asyncio.wait_for`. Audit: `grep -c wait_for` == 0 while `grep -c gather` >= 1 ⇒ suspect.

### Health check — run after editing ANY .py file

```bash
python3 -c "
import os, subprocess, ast
issues = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.'):
    dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in ('__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', '.git', 'node_modules')]
    for f in sorted(files):
        if not f.endswith('.py'): continue
        path = os.path.join(root, f)
        src  = open(path, errors='replace').read()
        if len(src) < 100: continue
        r = subprocess.run(['python3','-m','py_compile', path], capture_output=True)
        if r.returncode != 0:
            issues.append(f'COMPILE  {path}'); continue
        try:
            tree = ast.parse(src)
            has_main = any(isinstance(n, ast.FunctionDef) and n.name == 'main' for n in ast.walk(tree))
            if has_main and 'if __name__' not in src:
                issues.append(f'NO_ENTRY {path}')
        except: pass
        if not src.endswith('\n'):
            issues.append(f'NO_NL    {path}')   # truncated mid-write (Edit/Write byte limit)
print('ALL OK' if not issues else chr(10).join(issues))
"
```

`COMPILE` = syntax/import error. `NO_ENTRY` = `main()` defined but no
`if __name__ == "__main__": main()` (script exits silently doing nothing).
`NO_NL` = file truncated mid-write — repair the tail.

---

## Background worker threads (queue-drain pattern)

`search_runner.py` `_BackgroundCrawler` runs crawl batches on a daemon thread fed
by a `queue.Queue`. Two bugs caused the recurring
`[bg-crawl] wait() timed out after 300s` and silently dropped sites.

### RULE: drain on real outstanding work, never on `thread.is_alive()`

A daemon worker sits in `while True: queue.get()` so it is **always alive** until it
processes a shutdown sentinel. A drain loop gated on `thread.is_alive()` therefore
never exits early and spins the entire timeout on every call.

```python
# WRONG — always-alive worker means this spins the full timeout every time
while not self._queue.empty() or self._thread.is_alive():
    ...

# CORRECT — poll the queue's own outstanding-work counter
while self._queue.unfinished_tasks > 0:   # ++ on put, -- on task_done
    ...
```

### RULE: draining and shutdown are separate operations

A mid-run drain MUST keep the worker alive so the run can submit more work after it.
Only a single terminal `close()` may send the sentinel and `join()` the thread.

```python
def drain(self, timeout=300.0):   # non-destructive — call as often as needed
    while self._queue.unfinished_tasks > 0:
        if time.monotonic() > deadline:
            print("  [bg] still draining — waiting…")   # heartbeat, NOT give-up
            deadline = time.monotonic() + timeout       # re-arm, never abandon
        time.sleep(0.5)

def close(self, timeout=300.0):   # call ONCE at end of run
    self.drain(timeout)
    self._queue.put_nowait(None)  # sentinel
    self._thread.join(timeout=10.0)
```

A destructive `wait()` that sends the sentinel mid-run kills the worker; every later
`submit()` then queues work nothing consumes, and the next drain hits the timeout and
loses those items. Keep `wait()` only as a non-destructive alias for `drain()`.

### RULE: a drain timeout is a heartbeat, not a give-up

Re-arm the deadline and keep waiting (or loop the drain) so a backlog larger than one
timeout window still fully drains instead of being abandoned and dropped.

---

## Secrets / return-arity consistency

### RULE: `_load_secrets()` return arity MUST match every caller's unpack

Callers unpack `_load_secrets()` differently across the project — some expect one value,
some expect two:

```python
fb_key             = _load_secrets()   # single-value callers
fb_key, api_key    = _load_secrets()   # two-value callers (most enrich/check scripts)
api_key, fb_key    = _load_secrets()   # site_enrich_agent.py — note the ORDER
```

If a `_load_secrets()` is changed to `return get_firebase_cred()` while its caller still
does `fb_key, api_key = _load_secrets()`, it fails at runtime with
`TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable Certificate object`. `py_compile` and `pyflakes`
do NOT catch this.

**For two-value callers** (OpenAI key resolved from `cfg`/env at the call site) return:
```python
return get_firebase_cred(), None   # (firebase_cred, openai_key)
```

After editing any `_load_secrets()` or its caller, grep both ends and confirm they agree:
```bash
grep -n "= _load_secrets()" app/*.py        # caller unpack arity
grep -n "return .*get_firebase_cred"  app/*.py   # definition return arity
```

### RULE: `_init_firestore` must accept an already-built credential — never re-wrap

`_load_secrets()` returns `get_firebase_cred()`, which is already a
`firebase_admin.credentials.Certificate` object. Passing it back into
`creds.Certificate(fb_key)` raises at runtime:
`ValueError: Invalid certificate argument ... must be a file path, or a dict`.

`_init_firestore` must handle both a ready credential object and a dict/path:
```python
import firebase_admin.credentials as creds   # or 'as fb_creds'
cred = fb_key if isinstance(fb_key, creds.Base) else creds.Certificate(fb_key)
# else / default branch may still build from a path:
#   creds.Certificate(cfg.FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS or "config/serviceAccountKey.json")
```
`Certificate` subclasses `credentials.Base`, so the `isinstance(..., creds.Base)`
guard accepts any credential object while still wrapping a raw dict/path.
`py_compile` and `pyflakes` do NOT catch this — it only fails at run time.

---

## Windows asyncio event loop

### RULE: keep the Windows Selector event-loop policy in `_pathsetup.py`

On Windows the default Proactor event loop raises a noisy but harmless
`ConnectionResetError` from `_ProactorBasePipeTransport._call_connection_lost`
(socket.shutdown) when aiohttp closes sessions:

```
File ".../asyncio/proactor_events.py", line 165, in _call_connection_lost
    self._sock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
```

`app/_pathsetup.py` switches Windows to the Selector loop (works fine for
aiohttp/HTTP) so the traceback never appears:

```python
if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
    import asyncio as _asyncio
    _asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(_asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
```

This MUST run before any event loop is created — it lives in `_pathsetup`, which
every script imports first (`import _pathsetup` at the top). Never remove it, and
never create/run an event loop before `import _pathsetup`.

---

## Async CPU-bound work / response size caps

### RULE: `asyncio.wait_for` cannot cancel synchronous CPU work on the loop thread

`wait_for(coro, timeout)` only fires at `await` points. If a coroutine runs a long
**synchronous** operation (huge regex, `ElementTree` parse, `gzip.decompress`, decoding
a giant body), the single event-loop thread is busy in C code and never returns to the
scheduler — so the timeout never triggers and **every** consumer/producer on that loop
freezes at once. Symptom: the last line prints, then total silence (no per-site timeout
error after N seconds).

This froze `site_agent.py` at `[1325/4231]` on a dealer site that served a gzipped
sitemap: `resp.read()` + `gzip.decompress()` expanded to hundreds of MB and the decode +
parse blocked the loop.

### RULE: always cap response body size — never read/decompress/parse an unbounded body

```python
_MAX_BODY = 8_000_000
raw = await resp.content.read(_MAX_BODY + 1)     # bounded read, NOT resp.read()
if len(raw) > _MAX_BODY:
    raw = raw[:_MAX_BODY]
if raw[:2] == b"\x1f\x8b":                        # gzip — cap the DECOMPRESSED size too
    import gzip as _gzip, io as _io
    with _gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=_io.BytesIO(raw)) as _gz:
        raw = _gz.read(_MAX_BODY)                  # NOT gzip.decompress(raw) — bomb risk
text = raw.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")[:3_000_000]
```

If genuinely heavy parsing is unavoidable, move it off the loop with
`run_in_executor` (wrapped in `wait_for`) so a slow parse can't block other coroutines.

---

## Per-process isolation: classes, not single-point functions

The pipelines must be built from small isolated classes so one unit of work can
never hang the loop, crash siblings, or share mutable state. Shared building blocks
live in `app/functions/async_worker.py`.

### RULE: all HTTP body reads go through `BoundedFetcher` — never ad-hoc read functions

`BoundedFetcher` is the ONE place a response body is read. It caps the raw body and
the decompressed gzip, time-bounds the request, and NEVER raises (returns "" on any
failure). Do not write per-module read helpers that call `resp.read()` /
`resp.text()` directly — route them through `BoundedFetcher` (or a thin adapter over
it, like `site_agent._async_get`). This keeps the size caps from drifting and removes
single points of failure.

### RULE: each unit of work is an isolated `Worker` subclass

Wrap each per-item process (one site, one contact, one batch) in a `Worker` subclass
implementing `process() -> WorkerResult`. Call `run()` — it wraps `process()` in a
hard `asyncio.wait_for` plus a catch-all, so it NEVER raises and NEVER runs past its
timeout. One worker failing or timing out therefore cannot affect any sibling.

```python
worker = SiteWorker(session, url, ..., timeout=120.0)
res = await worker.run()          # -> WorkerResult: ok | excluded | timeout | error
```

`site_agent.py` is the reference: `SiteWorker(Worker)` per site, and `SitemapReader`
(a per-site class that owns its own visited set / fetch budget / discovered sitemaps)
so concurrent site reads share no mutable state.

### RULE: parallelise per-site child-sitemap reads, bounded by the connector

Child sitemaps within a site are fetched concurrently via `asyncio.gather`
(`SitemapReader._count_children`), throttled by the aiohttp connector's
`limit_per_host` (3) so it speeds up sitemap-heavy sites without hammering the server.
Keep `return_exceptions=True` on that gather so one bad child can't abort the level.

---

## README requirements

### RULE: README.md must always contain the Outreach Pipeline Architecture figure

The `README.md` must always contain the ASCII architecture diagram showing the full
pipeline from discovery to outreach sender. It lives under the heading
`## Outreach Pipeline Architecture` near the top of the file, before the detailed
pipeline sections.

If the diagram is missing, restore it — it should show:
- SITE PIPELINE and LEAD PIPELINE converging into `email_contacts`
- CRM Pipeline step (crm/ folder)
- Excel Export + Import Back step
- Automated Outreach Sender

Also ensure `README.md` always references `crm/README.md` for the CRM module and
includes the CRM section with key URLs (dashboard, API, sheets) and project structure.

Also ensure `crm/README.md` always contains the CRM pipeline flow figure at the top,
showing:
- email_contacts → Contact Sheet → CRM Template → Firestore + site_leads
- API flow: crmApi → Cloud Tasks → crmWorker → crm_jobs
- Dashboard URL: https://blueboot-market.web.app/

---

## Frontend / HTML rules

### RULE: Always use Bootstrap for HTML pages

All HTML pages in the `public/` folder must use Bootstrap 5 for layout and UI.
Load it from CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

Also use Tabler Icons for icons:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tabler/icons-webfont@3.19.0/dist/tabler-icons.min.css">
```

Only write custom `.css` when Bootstrap utilities cannot cover it.

---

## Frontend / CSS rules

### RULE: No inline styles on HTML elements — use CSS classes instead

Do not write `style="..."` directly on HTML elements unless there is absolutely no
other option (e.g. a truly one-off dynamic value set from JavaScript).

**Never write:**
```html
<thead style="background:#f9fafb">
<div style="font-size:.82rem;color:#6b7280;text-transform:uppercase">
```

**Always write:**
```html
<thead class="bb-thead">
<div class="bb-section-label">
```

If no suitable class exists yet, add one to `public/css/styles.css` first, then use
it. This keeps all visual decisions in one place and makes global changes trivial.

The only exceptions:
- Truly dynamic values set by JavaScript (e.g. `el.style.width = px + 'px'`)
- Bootstrap utility classes that already cover the case (prefer those over custom CSS)

---

## Frontend / Firestore rules

### RULE: No direct Firestore calls from the frontend — except authentication

All reads and writes to Firestore **must** go through the CRM API (`crmApi` Cloud
Function). The frontend is not allowed to call the Firestore REST API or SDK directly,
with one exception: Firebase Authentication (sign-in, sign-out, token refresh) which
must use the Firebase Auth SDK as today.

**Never write in frontend JS:**
```js
fetch(`https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/.../documents/...`, ...)
db.collection("...").document("...").set(...)
```

**Always route through the CRM API:**
```js
await fetchJSON(`${BASE}/api/crm/campaigns/${id}/contacts/${docId}`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify({ followup_status: 'contacted' }),
})
```

This keeps all validation, history logging, and business logic server-side, prevents
unauthorised direct writes, and makes the security rules auditable in one place.


---

## Job functions

### RULE: Every job function must have a CLI companion and be documented

Whenever a new job type is added to the CRM backend (`functions-crm/main.py` worker,
`crm/` lib file), three things are required before the work is considered done:

**1. A `app/<job_name>.py` CLI script** following the same conventions as the
other scripts in `app/`:
- `main(argv=None)` entry point with `argparse`
- `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` at the bottom
- Uses `get_firestore()` from `app.firestore_client` for Firestore access
- Path-inserts `functions-crm` to import the shared lib (no code duplication)
- Supports `--dry-run` to preview without writing
- Prints a clear summary on completion

**2. Both a `run_<job_name>.bat` (Windows) and `run_<job_name>.sh` (bash) launcher**
in the project root, following the style of the other launcher pairs:
- Activate `.venv` (`Scripts\activate.bat` / `bin/activate`)
- Set sensible parameter defaults overridable via `%*` / `"$@"`
- Exit with an error code on failure
- Mark the `.sh` file executable (`chmod +x`)

**3. Documentation** — add a section to `readme.md`
- What the job does
- All parameters with defaults

## Frontend job polling

### RULE: Every async job triggered from the frontend must show a visible status line

Any page that triggers a background job (via a trigger endpoint that returns a `job_id`)
must show a clear, persistent status line throughout the full lifecycle:

1. **Queued** — show the `job_id` and "polling for result…" using `alert-info`
2. **Done** — show a success summary using `alert-success`
3. **Error** — show the error message using `alert-danger`

Use a dedicated `<div id="sync-feedback" class="alert py-2 px-3 small mb-3" style="display:none"></div>`
placed just above the main content area. Never use a plain `<span>` or `console.log`
as the only status indicator.

The trigger button must be disabled while the job is running and re-enabled when done.

**Standard pattern:**
```js
function setFeedback(msg, type) {
  const fb = document.getElementById('sync-feedback');
  if (!type) { fb.style.display = 'none'; return; }
  fb.className = `alert alert-${type} py-2 px-3 small mb-3`;
  fb.innerHTML = msg;
  fb.style.display = '';
}

async function runJob() {
  const btn = document.getElementById('run-btn');
  btn.disabled = true;
  setFeedback(null);
  try {
    const res = await fetchJSON(`${BASE}/api/crm/my-job`, { method: 'POST', ... });
    setFeedback(`<i class="ti ti-clock me-1"></i>Job queued <code>${res.job_id}</code> — polling…`, 'info');
    await pollJob(res.job_id, {
      onDone:  result => setFeedback(`<i class="ti ti-check me-1"></i>Done — ${result.count} items.`, 'success'),
      onError: msg    => setFeedback(`<i class="ti ti-circle-x me-1"></i>Failed: ${escapeHtml(msg)}`, 'danger'),
    });
  } catch (e) {
    setFeedback(`<i class="ti ti-circle-x me-1"></i>Error: ${escapeHtml(e.message)}`, 'danger');
  } finally {
    btn.disabled = false;
  }
}
```

**Reference implementation:** `crm_follow.html` — `syncAllEmails()` and `syncContactEmails()`

## Cloud Batch script registry

### RULE: Every new `app/` script with `main()` must be added to cloud-batch.md

Whenever a new Python script is added to `app/` that has a `main(argv=None)` entry
point (i.e. it is a runnable CLI script), it MUST be added to the **Available App
Scripts** table in `public/doc/cloud-batch.md` before the work is considered done.

Place it in the appropriate table:
- **Currently in pipelines** -- if it is being added as a step in a new or existing
  `cloud_batch/job_definitions/*.json` pipeline
- **Pipeline candidates** -- if it is a new batch-eligible script not yet wired into
  a pipeline
- **Maintenance scripts** -- if it is a one-off data repair, export, or admin tool
- **Not suitable** -- if it is a dev diagnostic, smoke test, or dry-run-only tool

The table lives at: `public/doc/cloud-batch.md` under `## Available App Scripts`.

Verify the script appears there before closing the task.

---

## Documentation rules

### RULE: User guides contain no technical implementation details

User-facing documentation (`doc/user-guide.md`, `doc/crm-follow-up.md`, and any
other doc accessible from the Documentation menu) must describe **what** features
do and **how to use them** — never **how they are built**.

The following belong in `README.md`, `doc/system-architecture.md`,
`doc/installation.md`, or `doc/backend-functions.md` — not in user guides:

- API endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
- Firestore collection paths or document field names
- Database write strategies (ArrayUnion, field masks, transactions, etc.)
- Cloud Function names, job types, or queue names
- Internal class names, module paths, or library choices
- Any sentence that starts with "The backend…", "The API call…", or "Firestore…"

**Wrong (user guide):**
> All reads and writes go through the CRM API. Saving calls
> `PATCH /api/crm/campaigns/{id}/contacts/{doc_id}`.

**Right (user guide):**
> Changes are saved automatically as soon as you leave the field — no Save
> button needed.

**Right (system architecture / README):**
> Follow-up field writes go through `PATCH /api/crm/campaigns/{id}/contacts/{doc_id}`.
> The backend appends a `comment_history` entry using Firestore `ArrayUnion`.

## Frontend access control

### RULE: You must be at least `user` level to access any internal page

All pages except `index.html`, `login.html`, and `doc-viewer.html` (public pages)
require the signed-in user to have a role of `user`, `campaign-user`, or `admin`.

A signed-in user with **no role assigned** gets the role `guest`. Guests are
redirected to `index.html` automatically by `requireRole()` in `crm-common.js`
because `guest` is not included in any page's `PAGE_ROLES` entry.

`index.html` shows a visible warning banner to guests explaining that their account
is pending role assignment.

**Implementation:**
- `auth.js` — `_fetchRole()` falls back to `'guest'` (not `'user'`) when the
  Firestore user doc is missing or the role field is empty.
- `crm-common.js` — `PAGE_ROLES` lists allowed roles per page; none include `guest`.
  `requireRole()` redirects to `index.html` for any unlisted role.
- `index.html` — shows `#guest-notice` alert when the signed-in user has `guest` role.

**When adding a new page:** add it to `PAGE_ROLES` in `crm-common.js` with the
minimum required role. Never omit a page from `PAGE_ROLES` unless it is explicitly
a public page added to `PUBLIC_PAGES`.

---

## Access control documentation

### RULE: All access control rules must be documented in readme-access.md

`readme-access.md` (project root) is the single source of truth for all access
control documentation — roles, enforcement rules, Firestore paths, Blueprint
minimums, and how to add new protected endpoints.

When adding or changing any access rule (frontend or backend):

1. **Update `readme-access.md`** — keep the role table, Blueprint minimum table,
   and `PAGE_ROLES` listing current.
2. **Update `public/doc/installation.md`** — section 11 covers the first-admin
   setup and role assignment flow. Keep it aligned with any role or flow changes.
3. **No access rules live only in code** — if a role check, redirect, or Blueprint
   minimum is added, it must appear in `readme-access.md` within the same commit.

The two documents serve different audiences:
- `readme-access.md` — technical reference for developers (roles, API enforcement, code pointers)
- `installation.md` section 11 — operational guide for administrators (how to set up the first admin, assign roles to new users)

---

## Access control — guest read protection

### RULE: Any blueprint whose GET responses contain internal data must be in `_BLUEPRINTS_BLOCKED_FOR_GUESTS`

By default, authenticated GET requests are allowed for all roles including `guest`.
This is acceptable for purely public or non-sensitive read endpoints. However, any
blueprint whose GET responses include contact details, campaign data, file listings,
or other internal business data **must** be added to `_BLUEPRINTS_BLOCKED_FOR_GUESTS`
in `functions-crm/main.py`.

Currently blocked:

| Blueprint | Reason |
|---|---|
| `campaigns` | Campaign docs embed the full `campaign_contacts` subcollection |
| `contacts` | Direct reads of `campaign_contacts` via collection-group query |
| `gdisk` | Google Drive folder contents are internal |

**When adding a new blueprint or route, ask:** can a guest (signed in but no role)
see this response without any risk? If not, add the blueprint to the set.

**Checklist when adding a new blueprint:**
1. Add to `_BLUEPRINTS_BLOCKED_FOR_GUESTS` in `main.py` if GET returns sensitive data
2. Add to `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_ROLES` in `main.py` with the correct minimum role for writes
3. Add the endpoint to `_JOB_ENDPOINTS` in `main.py` if it triggers a background job
4. Update `readme-access.md` — all three sets must be kept current
5. Update `public/doc/installation.md` section 11 if the change affects user onboarding

## Role model — user role is read-only

### RULE: `user` role has read access only — all writes require `campaign-user`

The role model is:

| Role | GET reads | Writes (POST / PATCH / PUT / DELETE) |
|---|---|---|
| `guest` | blocked for sensitive blueprints | blocked everywhere |
| `user` | all internal data | **none** |
| `campaign-user` | everything | everything except admin endpoints |
| `admin` | everything | everything |

`user` must **never** appear as a minimum role in `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_ROLES` in
`functions-crm/main.py`. All mutating endpoints require at least `campaign-user`.

This means a `user`-level account can browse campaigns, contacts, the mailbox,
statistics, and the Drive folder — but cannot change any data, trigger any job,
or sync anything. They are a read-only observer.

When adding a new write endpoint, the minimum role is always `campaign-user`
or `admin` — never `user`.

---

## Access control — settings collection is admin-only

### RULE: Any endpoint that writes to the Firestore `settings` collection requires `admin`

The `settings` collection holds system-level configuration — mail accounts, Drive
folder, user roles, mail tag statuses. Only admins may modify any document under
this path, regardless of which Blueprint the endpoint belongs to.

Enforced via `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS` in `functions-crm/main.py`, which is checked
**after** the Blueprint minimum role. An endpoint in `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS` returns
403 for any role below `admin`, even if the Blueprint minimum would allow it.

Currently enforced:

| Endpoint | Writes to |
|---|---|
| `PUT /api/crm/settings/mail-tag-statuses` | `settings/mail_tag_statuses` |
| `POST/PATCH /api/crm/gdisk/settings` | `settings/gdisk` |

`mail_accounts` and `auth` blueprints already enforce `admin` at the Blueprint level
and do not need to appear in `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS`.

**When adding a new endpoint that writes to `settings/`:**
1. Add the Flask endpoint name to `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS` in `main.py`
2. Add a row to the Settings table in `readme-access.md`
3. Do NOT rely on the Blueprint minimum alone — `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS` is the explicit
   guard for all settings writes

---

## Access control — guest read protection

### RULE: Any blueprint whose GET responses contain internal data must be in `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_READ_ROLES`

By default, authenticated GET requests are allowed for all roles including `guest`.
This is acceptable for purely public or non-sensitive read endpoints. However, any
blueprint whose GET responses include contact details, campaign data, file listings,
or other internal business data **must** be added to `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_READ_ROLES`
in `functions-crm/main.py`.

Neither `guest` nor `user` roles can read from any blueprint in this map —
the minimum is always `campaign-user`.

Currently blocked:

| Blueprint | Min read role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `campaigns` | `campaign-user` | Campaign docs embed the full `campaign_contacts` subcollection |
| `contacts` | `campaign-user` | Direct reads of `campaign_contacts` via collection-group query |
| `gdisk` | `campaign-user` | Google Drive folder contents are internal |
| `mail_accounts` | `campaign-user` | Mail account credentials live under `settings/` |
| `auth` | `campaign-user` | User role docs live under `settings/users` |
| `mail_tags` | `campaign-user` | `settings/mail_tag_statuses` is system configuration |
| `mailbox` | `campaign-user` | IMAP mailbox contents are internal — no read for user/guest |

**When adding a new blueprint or route, ask:** can a guest or basic user see this
response without any risk? If not, add the blueprint to `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_READ_ROLES`.

**Checklist when adding a new blueprint:**
1. Add to `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_READ_ROLES` in `main.py` if GET returns sensitive data
2. Add to `_BLUEPRINT_MIN_ROLES` in `main.py` with the correct minimum role for writes
3. Add the endpoint to `_JOB_ENDPOINTS` in `main.py` if it triggers a background job
4. Add to `_ADMIN_ENDPOINTS` in `main.py` if it writes to the `settings` collection
5. Update `readme-access.md` — all four sets must be kept current
6. Update `public/doc/installation.md` section 11 if the change affects user onboarding

## Flask API handler structure

### RULE: Every handler file must import shared infrastructure from `handlers/shared.py`

All Blueprint handler files in `functions-crm/handlers/` must import their shared
infrastructure from `handlers/shared.py` — never reimplement it locally.

**Always import from shared:**
```python
from handlers.shared import _get_db, _err, _ok, _accepted  # pick what you need
```

**Never write local versions of:**
- `_get_db()` — Firestore singleton
- `_err(msg, code)` — error JSON response
- `_ok(msg, **kwargs)` — success JSON response
- `_accepted(job_id, name)` — 202 queued response
- `_new_job()`, `_enqueue_task()` — job/task helpers

**Standard handler file structure:**
```python
"""handlers/<name>.py — <short description>."""
from __future__ import annotations

from flask import Blueprint, g, jsonify, request

from handlers.shared import _get_db, _err, _ok

bp = Blueprint("<name>", __name__)

# ── Private helpers (module-specific only) ────────────────────────────────────

def _my_helper(...):
    ...

# ── Routes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

@bp.route("/api/crm/<route>", methods=["GET"])
def my_endpoint():
    """One-line docstring."""
    try:
        ...
        return jsonify(...)
    except Exception as exc:
        return _err(str(exc), 500)
```

**Response shapes — use the shared helpers consistently:**
- Success with data: `return jsonify({"status": "ok", ...data...})`
- Success with message: `return _ok("Done.", count=n)`
- Client error: `return _err("Reason.", 400)`
- Server error: `return _err(str(exc), 500)`
- Job queued: `return _accepted(job_id, "job-name")`

**Reference implementations:** `handlers/statistics.py` (simple GET + job trigger),
`handlers/user_prefs.py` (GET + PUT with per-user Firestore scoping via `g.user_email`).


## Owner / user dropdowns

### RULE: always display users as "Name (email)" — store email only

Whenever a user or owner is shown in a `<select>` or any dropdown UI, the visible
label must always be `DisplayName (email@...)`. If the user has no display name, show
just the email. The **stored value** (the `<option value="...">`) must always be the
email address — never the display name, never the UID.

```js
// Correct label + value pattern
const label = u.displayName ? `${u.displayName} (${u.email})` : u.email;
const value = u.email;   // always email
```

This applies to campaign owner, followup_owner, and any future user-assignment field.

## Owner filter on the follow-up page

### RULE: owner filter checks followup_owner first, then falls back to campaign owner

When filtering contacts by owner (the `owner` query param on `/api/crm/followup-contacts`),
apply this priority order:

1. If the contact has a `followup_owner` set → match against that field only.
2. If `followup_owner` is empty → fall back to the campaign-level `owner`.
3. For `__none__` (no owner) → the contact must have neither `followup_owner` nor
   campaign `owner` set.

This means a contact with an explicit `followup_owner` is **always** owned by that
person regardless of which campaign it belongs to, while unassigned contacts inherit
their campaign's owner.

Reference implementation: `handlers/contacts.py` → `followup_contacts()`.

## Frontend / table layout rules

### RULE: Name and email columns must never overlap — always use explicit widths

In any table that shows both a name and an email column, both columns must have
explicit pixel widths (never `width:auto` on either). Use at minimum:

```html
<th style="width:180px;min-width:140px">Name</th>
<th style="width:200px">Email</th>
```

`width:auto` on Name causes it to collapse into the Email column when other
columns are added or the viewport shrinks. Always set a concrete width.
