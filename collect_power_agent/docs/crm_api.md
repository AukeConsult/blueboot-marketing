# CRM API reference

All endpoints are served by the `crmApi` Cloud Function. Base URL:

```
https://us-central1-<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.cloudfunctions.net/crmApi
```

CORS is open (the static pages in `public/` call these directly). Responses are JSON
unless noted. Errors return `{"status":"error","message":"…"}` with a 4xx/5xx code.

Long-running work runs as **jobs**: a trigger endpoint returns a `job_id` immediately,
Cloud Tasks invokes `crmWorker`, and you poll `GET /api/crm/status/<job_id>` for the
result. See [Jobs](#jobs).

## Pipeline jobs (trigger → poll)

Each of these creates a job and returns `{status:"queued", job_id, poll}`.

| Method | Path | Query params | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/crm/contact-sync` | `countries` (csv, default `NO`), `max`, `status`, `campaign`, `min_pages`, `max_pages` | Import contacts from `email_contacts` into the contact sheet. |
| GET | `/api/crm/push-and-sync` | — | Push selected sheet rows to the CRM template. |
| GET | `/api/crm/template-sync` | — | Sync the CRM template back to the Leads Database. |
| GET | `/api/crm/campaign-sync` | `campaign_id` (required), `force` | Sync one campaign from the contact sheet to Firestore. |
| GET | `/api/crm/discover-campaigns` | — | Scan the contact sheet for campaign IDs; create/sync new ones. |

Example:

```
GET /api/crm/contact-sync?countries=NO,SE&max=500&min_pages=500
-> { "status":"queued", "job_id":"6a42ed55", "poll":"/api/crm/status/6a42ed55" }
```

## Jobs

> **Deployment note:** after adding new routes to `main.py`, run `firebase deploy --only functions:crm` before testing from the frontend. A missing deploy is the most common cause of "Failed to fetch" errors on new buttons.

| Method | Path | Query params | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/crm/status/<job_id>` | — | Get one job: `status` (`queued`/`running`/`done`/`error`), `result`, `error`, timings. |
| GET | `/api/crm/jobs` | `limit` (≤100, default 20), `running` (bool), `campaign_id`, `since` (minutes) | List recent jobs, newest first. |
| POST | `/api/crm/worker/<name>/<job_id>` | — | **Internal** — invoked by Cloud Tasks only. Do not call directly. |

## Campaigns

| Method | Path | Body | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/crm/campaigns` | — | List campaigns (`?status=` to filter), newest first. |

| POST·PATCH | `/api/crm/campaigns/<id>` | campaign fields (status, mail, …) | Update a campaign. |
| DELETE | `/api/crm/campaigns/<id>` | — | Delete a **draft** campaign.

Returns 409 if status is not `draft`. |
| PATCH | `/api/crm/campaigns/<id>/contacts/<doc_id>` | `{name?, title?, status?}` | Update editable fields on a single campaign contact. |

| POST | `/api/crm/campaigns/<id>/name-enrich` | `{dry_run?, skip_ai?}` | Enrich missing names — enqueues a `name-enrich` job (rules → Bing → Brave → AI). Returns `{job_id, poll}`. |
| POST | `/api/crm/name-enrich` | `{campaign_id?}` or `{emails:[…], dry_run?, skip_ai?}` | Same enrichment by campaign ID or flat email list. Returns `{job_id, poll}`. |
| GET | `/api/crm/leads/by-domain/<domain>` | — | Fetch lead data for a domain — checks `site_leads` first, then `leads`.

| POST·PATCH | `/api/crm/filter-facets/<name>` | full facets object (must contain `filters`) | Save a preset; also **enqueues a `filter-count` job** that refreshes keywords, counts matching sites/contacts and stores `counts` (including `selected_count` per value) back. Returns `{job_id, poll}`. |
| POST | `/api/crm/filter-facets/<name>/create-campaign` | `{campaign_id, dry_run?}` | Create (or refresh) a campaign from a saved facet preset.
