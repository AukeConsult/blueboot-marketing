# BlueBoot Agency Power Agent

Local Python lead-generation agent for finding web agencies, WordPress/WooCommerce providers, SEO agencies, digital agencies and communication agencies that may resell BlueSearch.

Supported countries: Norway (`NO`), Sweden (`SE`), Denmark (`DK`), Germany (`DE`), United Kingdom (`UK`), and any country with a `config/queries_<CODE>.txt` file.

---

## What the agent does

1. Loads country-specific search queries from `config/queries_<COUNTRY>.txt`.
2. Optionally scrapes curated agency directories (Clutch, Sortlist, DesignRush, GoodFirms, etc.).
3. Runs a GitHub organisation pre-pass to find agency orgs with a website.
4. Searches Bing (or Google Custom Search if configured), requiring all query words in every result.
5. Filters candidate domains against a domain blocklist (`config/blocklist_domains.txt`).
6. Crawls each website and selected internal pages (contact, about, services, cases).
7. Extracts emails, phone numbers, contact pages, and LinkedIn company links.
8. Detects technologies: WordPress, WooCommerce, Webflow, Shopify, HubSpot, and more.
9. Classifies and scores each lead (0–100) for reseller fit.
10. Generates a suggested sales angle.
11. Writes results to Firestore in real time (one upsert per crawled site).
12. Exports to `output/agency_leads.xlsx`, `.csv`, and `.json`.

## `lead_agent.py` — all parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--mode` | `both` | `search` = Bing/Google keyword search; `catalog` = scrape directory listings; `both` = catalog first, then search; `audit` = run database cleanup passes (see below) |
| `--countries` | all configured | Comma-separated ISO codes, e.g. `NO,SE,DK` |
| `--queries` | _(per-country files)_ | Path to a custom queries file (overrides per-country files) |
| `--output` | `output` | Directory for Excel/CSV/JSON output files |
| `--max-results` | `200` | Max Bing/Google results per query |
| `--min-score` | `50` | Minimum reseller score (0–100) to store a lead |
| `--max-pages` | `3` | Max pages to crawl per agency website |
| `--max-country` | `5000` | Stop a country once this many leads are found (0 = unlimited) |
| `--give-up-after` | `10` | Give up a country after this many consecutive empty queries |
| `--delay` | `1.0` | Seconds to wait between page fetches within one site |
| `--workers` | `20` | Parallel crawl workers / batch size |
| `--max-catalog-pages` | _(unlimited)_ | Limit pages per catalog source (useful for testing) |
| `--no-output` | off | Skip writing the Excel/CSV/JSON files |
| `--no-firebase` | off | Skip uploading results to Firestore |
| `--no-github` | off | Skip the GitHub org pre-pass |
| `--firebase-preload` | off | _(legacy flag, now always active)_ Preload seen domains from Firestore |
| `--firebase-collection` | `leads` | Override Firestore collection name |

### Audit mode (`--mode audit`)

Scans the entire `leads` collection and applies three cleanup passes. Always run with `--audit-dry-run` first.

```bat
python app\lead_agent.py --mode audit --audit-dry-run
python app\lead_agent.py --mode audit
```

| Pass | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Pass 1 — TLD corrections** | Leads with a ccTLD belonging to a different known country are re-assigned (`country` + `country_name` updated, original saved to `country_original`). Leads with a global TLD (`.com` / `.org` / `.net`, configurable in `countries.json` → `global_tlds`) are set to `country="*"` / `country_name="global"`. Leads with an unrecognised TLD not in `accepted_tlds` are deleted. |
| **Pass 2 — Contact audit** | Contacts with a blank or malformed email address are deleted. |
| **Pass 3 — Blocklist re-check** | Leads whose domain, website URL, company name, title, or description match the blocklist or content-negative keywords are deleted. |

### Discovery modes (`--mode`)

- **`search`** — runs Bing/Google queries, applies the full domain blocklist.
- **`catalog`** — scrapes curated agency directories (Clutch, Sortlist, DesignRush, etc.); blocklist is **not** applied since catalog sources are already curated.
- **`both`** — catalog runs first, then search. Domains found in catalog phase are skipped during search.

### Example runs

```bash
# Norway only, both modes, stop at 200 leads
python app/lead_agent.py --countries NO --mode both --max-country 200

# Scandinavia search-only, 50 results per query
python app/lead_agent.py --countries NO,SE,DK --mode search --max-results 50

# Catalog only, first 5 pages per source (test run)
python app/lead_agent.py --mode catalog --max-catalog-pages 5 --no-github

# Full run, no output file, no Firebase (dry run)
python app/lead_agent.py --countries NO --no-output --no-firebase
```

## `extract_leads.py` — export a filtered extract from Firestore

Reads lead documents and their contacts sub-collections directly from Firestore and writes a focused Excel file. No local CSV is required. Global leads (`country="*"`) are excluded from all extracts.

```bat
python app\extract_leads.py [options]
```

### Filter parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--collection` | `leads` | Firestore collection name |
| `--output` | `<project_root>/output` | Directory to write the Excel file |
| `--min-score` | `0` | Minimum reseller_score to include |
| `--max-score` | `100` | Maximum reseller_score to include |
| `--country CODE` | all | Country code(s), comma-separated or repeatable: `--country NO,SE` |
| `--source` | all | `search` / `catalog` / `both` — filter by discovery mode |
| `--query TEXT` | _(none)_ | Substring match on `source_query` (case-insensitive) |
| `--priority P` | all | Priority label(s), repeatable: `--priority A --priority B` |
| `--with-email` | off | Only include leads with at least one contact email |
| `--keywords KW` | _(none)_ | Comma-separated keywords (OR logic). A lead matches if **any** keyword appears in `source_query`, `title`, `description`, `company`, `domain`, `website`, `keywords`, or `reasons`. E.g. `--keywords wordpress,woocommerce` |
| `--limit N` | _(none)_ | Maximum number of leads to include. Applied after all other filters; stops the Firestore stream early once reached. |
| `--out FILE` | auto-timestamped | Output filename |

### Save-extract parameters

Saving an extract persists the filtered leads to a dedicated `leads_extract` Firestore collection. A lead can only belong to **one** extract — any lead already in a previous extract is automatically skipped (detected via a `collectionGroup` query on `leads_extracted`, no fields are written back to the main `leads` collection).

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--save-extract NAME` | _(none)_ | Save extract to `leads_extract/<NAME>` in Firestore |
| `--extract-dry-run` | off | Preview what `--save-extract` would write without touching Firestore |

### Firestore structure written by `--save-extract`

```
leads_extract/
  {extract_name}/
    name, created_at, lead_count, contact_count, filters{…}
    leads_extracted/
      {lead_id}/
        (all lead fields)
        contacts_extracted/
          {contact_id}/   (all contact fields)
```

### Output Excel sheets

- **Extract** — one row per email contact with all lead fields merged in; leads without email appear at the bottom.
- **Leads** — one row per lead (raw Firestore fields).
- **Summary** — filter criteria, counts, and extract name.

### Example runs

```bat
REM A-priority Norwegian leads with email, score ≥ 70
python app\extract_leads.py --min-score 70 --country NO --priority A --with-email

REM Catalog-sourced leads across Norway and Sweden
python app\extract_leads.py --source catalog --country NO,SE

REM All leads matching a specific query keyword
python app\extract_leads.py --query "webbyrå"

REM Keyword search — WordPress or WooCommerce leads
python app\extract_leads.py --keywords wordpress,woocommerce

REM Dry-run: preview what would be saved to Firestore
python app\extract_leads.py ^
  --keywords wordpress ^
  --country NO,SE ^
  --min-score 60 ^
  --save-extract "wordpress_nordic_may26" ^
  --extract-dry-run

REM Live save — writes to leads_extract/wordpress_nordic_may26
python app\extract_leads.py ^
  --keywords wordpress ^
  --country NO,SE ^
  --min-score 60 ^
  --save-extract "wordpress_nordic_may26"

REM Second extract — already-extracted leads are skipped automatically
python app\extract_leads.py ^
  --keywords shopify ^
  --country NO,SE ^
  --save-extract "shopify_nordic_jun01"
```

### Function API

```python
from extract_leads import extract_leads

path = extract_leads(
    min_score=70,
    countries=["NO", "SE"],
    source="search",
    priorities=["A", "B"],
    with_email=True,
    keywords=["wordpress", "woocommerce"],
    save_extract="wordpress_nordic_may26",
    extract_dry_run=False,
    out_file="my_extract.xlsx",
)
```

## `gmail_outreach.py` — send outreach emails via Gmail

Sends personalised outreach emails to contacts from an Excel file, tracks opens and replies, and avoids re-sending to anyone who has already replied.

```bash
cd app
python gmail_outreach.py [options]
```

Requires Gmail OAuth credentials (`credentials.json` in the project root). On first run the browser opens for authorisation; a `token.json` is saved for future runs.

---

## Output files

After a run, the `output/` directory contains:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `agency_leads.xlsx` | Leads sheet + Contacts sheet + Dashboard + Queries |
| `agency_leads.csv` | All leads, one row per lead |
| `agency_contacts.csv` | All contacts, one row per email address |
| `agency_leads.json` | All leads as JSON |
| `agency_contacts.json` | All contacts as JSON |
| `extract_leads_*.xlsx` | Filtered extracts produced by `extract_leads.py` |

### Key columns in leads

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `company` | Agency name (derived from domain) |
| `website` | Canonical website URL |
| `country` / `country_name` | ISO code and full name |
| `emails` | Comma-separated email addresses |
| `phones` | Comma-separated phone numbers |
| `linkedin` | LinkedIn company page URL |
| `detected_tech` | Technologies detected on the site |
| `categories` | Agency category labels |
| `reseller_score` | Fit score 0–100 |
| `priority` | A / B / C based on score |
| `reasons` | Scoring rationale |
| `suggested_angle` | Recommended BlueSearch sales angle |
| `found_by_search` | `yes` if discovered via keyword search |
| `found_by_catalog` | `yes` if discovered via directory catalog |
| `crawled_at` | ISO timestamp of last crawl |

---

## Configuration files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/countries.json` | Per-country settings: language, TLDs, keywords, phone region |
| `config/queries_<CODE>.txt` | Search queries per country |
| `config/blocklist_domains.txt` | Domain glob patterns and content negative keywords to exclude |
| `config/catalogs.json` | Directory catalog sources and page counts per country |

### `config/blocklist_domains.txt`

Single source of truth for all domain filtering. Contains two types of entries:

- **Domain glob patterns** (e.g. `*pizza*`, `*hotel*`) — any domain matching a pattern is skipped during search.
- **Content negative keywords** (under the `CONTENT NEGATIVE KEYWORDS` section) — plain substrings checked against visible page text during scoring; two or more occurrences trigger a score penalty.

Blocklist filtering applies to **search mode only**. Catalog sources are pre-curated and bypass the blocklist.

---

## Firebase / Firestore

Results are written to Firestore in real time as each site is crawled. Structure:

```
leads/{lead_id}                                                  — one document per agency
leads/{lead_id}/contacts/{id}                                    — one document per email address

leads_extract/{extract_name}                                     — one document per named extract
leads_extract/{extract_name}/leads_extracted/{lead_id}           — extracted lead snapshot
leads_extract/{extract_name}/leads_extracted/{lead_id}/
    contacts_extracted/{contact_id}                              — extracted contact snapshot
```

The `leads_extract` collection is populated by `extract_leads.py --save-extract`. A lead can belong to at most one extract; duplicates are detected via a `collectionGroup` query on `leads_extracted` before each run.

Credentials are loaded from (in order):

1. `blueboot_secrets.py` in the project root (`fireBaseAdminKey` dict)
2. `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable (path to a service account JSON)
3. `config/serviceAccountKey.json`

At startup, already-crawled domains are preloaded from Firestore so they are never re-crawled within the same run or across runs.

---

## Optional Google Search API

The agent works without API keys using Bing as fallback. For more stable results, add Google Custom Search credentials to `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_cse_id
```

---

## Notes

- Use reasonable rate limits (`--delay`, `--workers`) and only collect public business contact information.
- This agent is designed for B2B lead research, not aggressive scraping or spam.
- `blueboot_secrets.py` is never committed to version control.

## `statistics.py` — lead statistics & Firestore aggregations

Reads all leads and contacts from Firestore, computes aggregated statistics, writes results back to a `statistics` collection, and exports Excel reports to `output/`.

```bash
cd app
python statistics.py [options]
```

Runs **both** aggregations by default. Use `--only` to target one.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--leads-collection` | `leads` | Firestore collection to read leads from |
| `--stats-collection` | `statistics` | Firestore collection to write statistics into |
| `--output` | `output/` | Directory for Excel output files |
| `--only` | _(both)_ | `priority` or `reasons` — run only one aggregation |
| `--no-excel` | off | Skip writing Excel files |
| `--no-writeback` | off | Skip writing `reasons-list` back to each lead document |

### Aggregation 1 — Priority × Country

Counts leads and contacts per country, broken down by priority (A / B / C / unset).

Firestore structure written:

```
statistics/priority-pr-country               ← head document (grand totals + by_priority summary)
statistics/priority-pr-country/countries/NO  ← one sub-document per country
statistics/priority-pr-country/countries/SE
...
```

Head document fields: `generated_at`, `total_leads`, `total_contacts`, `country_codes`, `by_priority`.

Each country sub-document fields: `country`, `country_name`, `total_leads`, `total_contacts`, `by_priority`.

Excel output: `output/statistics.xlsx` — sheets **Summary**, **By Priority**, **By Country**, **Country x Prio**.

### Aggregation 2 — Reasons Count

Parses each lead's `reasons` field (`;`-separated signals, `:`-separated label/detail, `/`-separated compound labels) into individual reason tokens, counts occurrences per country, and optionally writes the parsed list back to each lead.

Delimiters applied in order:
- `;` — separates distinct reason groups
- `:` — strips detail, keeps label (`"wordpress: site, plugins"` → `"wordpress"`)
- `/` — expands compound labels (`"has services/customers/cases language"` → `"has services"`, `"customers"`, `"cases language"`)

Firestore structure written:

```
statistics/reasons-count               ← head document (global reason counts)
statistics/reasons-count/countries/NO  ← one sub-document per country
statistics/reasons-count/countries/SE
...
```

Reason counts are stored as a list of `{reason, count}` objects sorted by count descending.

Each lead document is also updated with a `reasons-list` field (array of parsed reason strings) unless `--no-writeback` is passed.

Excel output: `output/statistics_reasons.xlsx` — sheets **Global Reasons**, **By Country**.

### Example runs

```bash
# Run both aggregations (default)
python statistics.py

# Priority stats only, no Excel
python statistics.py --only priority --no-excel

# Reasons count only, skip writing back to leads
python statistics.py --only reasons --no-writeback

# Write to a non-default stats collection
python statistics.py --stats-collection statistics_test
```

### Function API

```python
from statistics import summarise_country_pr_priority, summarise_reasons_count
from statistics import export_to_excel, export_reasons_to_excel

# Priority aggregation
results = summarise_country_pr_priority(leads_collection="leads")
export_to_excel(results, outdir="output")

# Reasons aggregation (writeback on by default)
results = summarise_reasons_count(leads_collection="leads", writeback=True)
export_reasons_to_excel(results, outdir="output")
```
